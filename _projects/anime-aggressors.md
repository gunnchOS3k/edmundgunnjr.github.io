# Anime Aggressors — Arena-Style PVP Experiments

**Arena-style PVP experiments with ultra-low latency**

## The Concept

A Shōnen-inspired brawler that combines the intensity of anime combat with the precision of competitive fighting games. Think Smash Bros meets Dragon Ball Z.

## Technical Challenges

### Input Latency Budgets
- **Target**: Sub-16ms input processing
- **Rollback Netcode**: Predictive input handling for smooth online play
- **Controller Pipeline**: Direct input processing bypassing OS layers

### Haptics Integration
- **DualSense Support**: Adaptive triggers and haptic feedback
- **EdgeZIO Wearables**: Experimental gesture controls
- **Force Feedback**: Dynamic resistance based on character power levels

## Game Engine

- **Godot 4**: Modern 2D/3D hybrid rendering
- **React Integration**: Web-based UI for menus and lobbies
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, and web builds

## Research Applications

This project serves as a testbed for:
- **URLLC Applications**: Ultra-reliable low-latency communication
- **Edge Computing**: Distributed game state management
- **Haptic Feedback**: Next-generation controller interfaces

## Current Status

Ongoing development with focus on input latency optimization and haptic feedback systems. Planning to integrate with 6G research for ultra-low latency wireless gaming.

## Concept → Engine Spikes → Controller I/O

The project explores the intersection of competitive gaming and cutting-edge wireless technology, with a focus on creating the next generation of responsive, immersive gaming experiences.
